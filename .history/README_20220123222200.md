  ## Description

  This simple program uses express to save and delete notes. Notes are saved on the backend and then populate a sidebar list for browsing.  Useful for class!

  ## Installation
  
  Use 'npm i express' if missing to download the express package. 

  
  ## Usage
  
  Click the Get Started button to go to the note-taking page. Write whatever you want in the title and body fields, then you can click the save button to save your note, or click the plus button to start over with a blank note. Saved notes will be displayed in a sidebar on the left. Click on the note titles to display those notes. You can click the red trash can buttons on your saved notes if you wish to delete them.

  ## Challenges

  This project was a bit finnicky to get working. JavaScript is very particular about formatting, and I had to spend a while debugging the save and delete buttons, hence all the commits. Turns out my delete button was just missing its event listener (doh!). My project was saving the notes on the back-end, but wasn't displaying them, which was easy enough to fix. I had to alter quite a bit of the starter code's formatting to get things up and running. Overall I'm happy with the final product, although I wish my debugging skills were a little better.
